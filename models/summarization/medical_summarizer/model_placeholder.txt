PLACEHOLDER: Medical Summarization Model

This file represents a placeholder for a trained
medical text summarization model.

Expected formats in future:
- HuggingFace model directory
- PyTorch checkpoint (.pt)
- Safetensors (.safetensors)

Current system uses:
- Named Entity Recognition
- Keyword extraction
- Rule-based structuring

This placeholder exists to demonstrate
project extensibility and architectural completeness.
